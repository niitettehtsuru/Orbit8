Animated mathematical art consisting of a series of curves rotating about a central point. 

How does it work?
-----------------
The project is made up of a stack of 10 Lissajous curves with a lobe ratio of 2:1 rotating
at the same phase angle about a center. <br>
The curves are vertically stacked by maintaining a constant relative width whiles varying the relative height 
of each curve.
